## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Post outlines — a responsive "On this page" table of contents on
  `/posts/[slug]`. Headings are extracted at build time (Contentlayer
  `headings` field, slugs matching `rehype-slug`). On wide screens it shows as
  a small-font fixed rail in the left gutter (wider on 2xl) with scroll-spy and
  smooth-scroll; below `xl` it collapses into a compact disclosure above the
  article so mobile reading flow stays clean.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` — formal deploy contract for Vercel.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — system blueprint for the portfolio + knowledge artifacts.
- `VERSION` + this `CHANGELOG.md` — release discipline scaffolding.

### Fixed
- Post outline rendered twice on `/posts/[slug]` — a branch merge re-introduced
  the `<Toc>` that an earlier commit had relocated, so each page showed two
  overlapping fixed rails on desktop and two "On this page" disclosures on
  mobile. Removed the duplicate, keeping the single outline above the article.
- Article pages no longer scroll horizontally. `html` now uses `overflow-x: clip`
  (a hard guarantee that's safe with the sticky sidebar and fixed TOC since
  `clip` creates no scroll container), and `.prose` wraps long unbreakable
  tokens (`overflow-wrap: break-word`). Wide tables / code still scroll inside
  their own box.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — corrected the knowledge-artifact flow: published JSX is
  compiled **server-side at build time** (`force-static` →
  `transformJSXAtBuild` → `buildJSXDoc` → sandboxed iframe), not in the
  reader's browser. Browser-side `esbuild-wasm` runs only in the playground.
  Updated the diagram, system overview, components, flows, CSP rationale,
  security sandbox, and failure modes to match.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` + `DEPLOYMENT.md` — corrected the security-headers claim:
  `securityHeaders` in `next.config.js` is defined but never wired via a
  `headers()` export, so no app-level CSP / X-Frame / Referrer / Permissions
  headers are emitted (production carries only Vercel's default HSTS).
  Documented as a known gap with a wiring follow-up.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-01

Baseline release. Snapshot of the site as it shipped to `arno.surfacew.com`
before formal release docs existed. Highlights of work prior to this version:

### Added
- Blog at `/posts/[slug]` powered by Contentlayer + MDX, bilingual (en / zh).
- Knowledge gallery at `/knowledge` rendering standalone JSX/HTML artifacts
  via runtime esbuild-wasm transform.
- Topics index at `/posts/topics` with tag + language filtering.
- Image upload API at `/api/images` backed by Vercel Blob (sk-gated).
- Dynamic `sitemap.ts` covering posts, tag pages, and listed artifacts.
- RSS feed at `/posts/rss`.
- Google Analytics (G-2SWQ9FNXGM) and custom CSP / security headers.

### Notes
- Versions prior to 0.1.0 were not tagged. Git history (`git log`) is the
  reference for earlier work.
