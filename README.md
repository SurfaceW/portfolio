# Arno's Digital Garden: Portfolio & Tech Musings

Welcome to my digital garden! This space is a blend of a personal portfolio and a blog where I share insights on software development, explore front-end technologies, and document my creative projects. Dive in to discover my work and thoughts on the ever-evolving tech landscape.

Inspired by and based on the work of: https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/

## Local Development

### Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:** (You've likely already done this if you're reading this!)
2.  **Install dependencies:** Open your terminal in the project root and run:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:** After installation, start the development server with:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    This will typically start the server on `http://localhost:3000`.
