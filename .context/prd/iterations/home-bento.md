# Refined Apple-Inspired Bento Grid Home Page

Let's implement an elegant Apple-inspired bento grid layout for the home page with refined aesthetics:

## Design Principles

* **Clean aesthetics**: Light, airy background with subtle gradients and minimal shadows
* **Refined typography**: Clear hierarchical typography with appropriate spacing
* **Subtle animations**: Gentle hover effects and micro-interactions
* **Apple-inspired** rounded corners, subtle shadows, and translucent elements
* **Variable sizing**: Larger cards for important content (articles)
* **Dynamic contrast**: Thoughtful color accents instead of overwhelming deep backgrounds

## Grid Layout

The grid should be fluid, responsive, and asymmetric with varied card sizes:

### Featured Elements (Larger Cards)

1. **Profile Spotlight** (Large Card - 2x2)
   * High-quality avatar image of Arno
   * Title: AI Developer, Engineer, Product Designer
   * Subtle animated gradient border on hover
   * Minimalist design with ample whitespace

2. **Featured Articles Section** (Large Card - 2x2)
   * Takes prominence with larger space
   * Elegant grid of top 5 articles with visual hierarchy:

### Supporting Elements (Compact Cards - 1x1)

5. **Work Showcase** (Three compact cards with consistent styling)

## Visual Treatment

* **Color Palette**: Soft neutrals as base with strategic accent colors
* **Card Styling**: Subtle border radius, thin borders, and minimal shadows
* **Background**: Light gradient or subtle texture instead of deep colors
* **Glass Effect**: Refined glassmorphism with appropriate opacity levels
* **Micro-interactions**: Subtle scale and shadow changes on hover
* **Responsive Adaptation**: Graceful reflow for different screen sizes

## Technical Implementation Notes

* Use CSS Grid for the primary layout structure
* Implement fluid card sizing with appropriate gap spacing
* Apply subtle GSAP animations for refined interactions
* Optimize for performance by lazy-loading images and content
* Ensure accessibility with proper contrast and keyboard navigation
