> üìè Without rules, nothing can be accomplished.

These days, I have been busy with SDK design related to the business domain at work. During the design process, I hope to gather ideas and provide some design references.

# Definition of SDK

SDK, as the name implies, Software Developer Kit, generally includes:

- Frameworks that support software programming runtime
- Programming interfaces (APIs) exposed by internal modules
- Supporting developer tools (IDE, CLI, etc.)

# Design Principles

To design an SDK that serves a wide range of developers well, I have extracted some important design principles from a series of articles:

**"Clear Structure"**: Make the SDK easy to use

- **Minimal Core**: The number of APIs should be as few as possible; less is more
- **Single Responsibility**: Classes and modules should have loosely coupled functionalities without specific business logic
- **Extension Mechanism**: Non-core functionalities should be implemented through external extensions to decouple from core modules
- **Consistent Naming**: Use a consistent naming convention and be cautious with API naming
- **Simple Design**: Keep API input/output parameters and functionalities as simple as possible, aiming for thin interface design and atomic function methods
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation, including API specs and usage guides

**"Stable and High Performance"**: Ensure the API's performance and quality are reliable

- **Testing Assurance**: Use unit tests and CI mechanisms to ensure API stability
- **Performance Focus**: Perform performance analysis and optimization for high-frequency APIs
- **Asynchronous Interfaces**: Use asynchronous calls in scenarios where blocking the main process is not recommended
- **Effective Logging**: Provide comprehensive runtime logs for APIs to facilitate debugging and ensure application stability
- **Reduce Size**: Minimize the size of SDKs, frameworks, and related API packages

**"Backward Compatibility"**: Provide compatibility strategies to ensure consistent API behavior

- **Consistency**: Provide version tracking mechanisms and keep API names, input/output parameters, and functionalities unchanged
- **Gradual Evolution**: For APIs that require breaking changes, use the @deprecated identifier to notify developers to upgrade, and provide sufficient time (usually 2-3 major versions) before removal
- **Release Notes**: Provide comprehensive release notes for APIs or SDKs

Of course, some important design patterns and guidelines in software engineering can also improve the code design quality of SDKs, such as:

- [Mainstream Software Design Patterns](https://www.yuque.com/surfacew/ggwv30/fs5h7r) (Factory, Facade, etc.)
- [S.O.L.I.D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID): Principles of modular (OO) development
- [GRASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_\(object-oriented_design\)): Object-oriented design principles
- KISS: Keep it simple and stupid

# Example Design Goals

Taking the xstate state machine library design as an example [x-state-design-goals](https://xstate.js.org/docs/about/goals.html#api-goals):

- Adherence to the W3C SCXML Specification and David Harel's original statecharts formalism
- Promote an Actor model event-based architecture
- Compatibility with all frameworks and platforms
- Ability to completely serialize machine definitions to JSON (and SCXML)
- Pure, functional createMachine(...) API
- Zero dependencies
