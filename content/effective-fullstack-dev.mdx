## Think and impl. in a full-stack way

* Core of FullStack dev.
  * **Design Conceptual Integration** of product design, ux, native, web, mobile, desktop, cloud, edge, ai, ...🚀.
  * **Biz and Problem Driven** to solve problem with skills like swiss knife 🇨🇭, driven by your own ideas 🤔.
  * **Embrace of Elegant and CutEdged Tech.** to make your product more effective, competitive and innovative 🦄.
    * Prisma
    * TailwindCSS
    * React, Next.js
    * OpenAI / Github Copilot
    * Turbo-repo / Turbo-pack
    * Swr / React Query
    * ...
* The Three *Musketeers* of the Web in the New Era: `Typescript*` + `React*` + `TailwindCSS*`, use *React way* to achieve *FullStack way*.
  * **Great Eco-system** of TS(JS / EcmaScript) and NPM. 🌍 -> Arms of Giants
  * **React core conceptions, patterns and abstractions** in Native, Web, and Server as Components. -> Design Consistency
  * **Stateless and Serverless** next.js make it in a natural-way to do so, and generate its principles to develop its systems. -> Scalability and Simplicity
* **Geek and Hacker Spirit** to seek high quality and high performance of your product 🌟.
  * Responsive and Token driven theme Design system
  * Dark scheme compatible
  * Rich interactive and animated UI
  * PWA / SPA / SSR / SSG / ESR / AOT ... combination with flexible design to boost performance
    * -> Micro Frontend is the past pone now.
    * -> C++ / Rust -> WASM is the performance boost in the future cross-platforms such as tik-token impl.
  * ...

## One Repo to rule them all

> Benefits of One Repo.

* Dependency Consistency with `pnpm` workspace system.
  * All shared dependencies are managed by pnpm with single locked version which reduce the risk of dependency conflicts and size of node_modules.
  * Flatting the dependency tree to reduce the size of node_modules and make it more consistent.
  * Use workspace linkages to share packages among projects
* Large amount of Code sharing across multiple projects of different platforms.
  * Core data structure share: from db -> server -> client
    * The power of `Prisma` database devOps.
  * Core architecture share: from server -> client with safe unit tests to assure the consistency of the architecture.
  * UI components share: from server -> client -> shared components
  * Business logic share: from client hook, to server services, to shared managers, to shared utils / sdks.
  * Sample lib share diagram to show the power of one repo with packages.
* Devops Consistency: flexible CI/CD pipelines with `Aone` / DEF / Devops platforms.
  * FE projects deploy to CDN with DEF.
  * BE projects deploy to K8S of alibaba with `Aone`.
  * Chrome Extension projects deploy to Chrome Web Store with devtool.
  * SDK is published to NPM with devtool.
* Architecture consistency: use proper design patterns and architecture guide to make things work perfectly.
  * see -> `Architecture.md` in demo-repo.
  * Swagger API doc for third-party API integration and invocations.
* Super fast debug & tests with both FE / Server at the same time, of the same code base.
* Turbo Technology Series: what make 17+ repo work together in a single repo.
  * Unified tasks design with pipeline and task dependencies.
  * Incremental task running cache: cooperation with `pnpm` workspace system to reduce your time, such as run unit-tests among all projects.
  * Future possible remote task cache with DevOPS CI / CD process.
  * Next.js engineering with `Turbo-pack`, `Rust`, `swc` to boost the performance of local dev process.
  * ...
* Breach the Limitations of Alibaba `Aone` Cloud env
  * `Node.js` 18 is not supported yet, but we can use it in a tricky way.
  * `Next.js` need to adapt some middleware to make it work in Internal Cloud env.

## Boost the power of AI

> Make fully use of AI to generate code for u.

* Buy and use Github copilot. 15% ~ 20%
* Chat with latest AI model to solve problems. 10% ~ 15%
* AI single bot with POE as code-generator & assistant. 30% ~ 50%

Demo: a simple workflow for AIStudio demands from DevOPS of basic-infra team.

Future way of AI?

* Future shape of AI Agent is with RAG, Tools, multiple agent via LLM in AIStudio PromptStudio.
