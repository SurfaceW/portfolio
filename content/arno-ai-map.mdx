## AI Working Procedure

In general, we can divide the AI working procedure into three main ways:

* **Human First, AI Assist**: human is focusing on the high-level tasks and design to instruct AI for high-level decision making or cross-multiple domain tasks.
* **AI First, Human Assist in Sync**: human design the task and instruct AI to do the task in a synchronous way, and human is focusing on revise and review the AI's work till the task is done.
* **AI First, Human Assist in Async**: human design the task and instruct AI to do the task in an asynchronous way, AI using `Agentic` approach to do the task, and human is focusing on later review and revise the AI's work till the task is done. These tasks are usually self-contained and not coupled with other domains, so AI can work independently.

Let's take software development as an example:

### Human First, AI Assist

* app production, tech-architecture, and market high-level design
* core modules, core features, and core functions design
* key-decision making about the technology stack, architecture, and modules features
* complex problem solving and reasoning, such as systematic and systemic reasoning
* ...

> In this mode, Arno try to create `Elaboration Studio` [e-studio.ai](https://e-studio.ai) to leverage the power of AI and personal context engineering to do the high-level design and decision making, and then use the AI to assist in the low-level tasks.

### AI First, Human Assist in Sync

* app development, coding, and programming in specific modules
* write PRD, design documents, and technical documents
* code review, PR review, and design review
* software development lifecycle, such as devops, CI/CD, and testing
* ...

> In this mode, dedicated AI tools are used to assist in the coding and programming tasks, such as `Cursor`, `Github Copilot`, and `V0`. These tools are designed to work in sync with human developers, providing real-time assistance and suggestions.

### AI FFirst, Human Assist in Async

* do market or product research
* write unit-test and integration-test
* refactor modules, features, and functions
* batch job on data processing or information processing
* ...

> In this mode, AI tools are used to work independently on specific tasks, such as `Google Deep Research`, `Manus` and `Google Jules` which can run in the server-end or background without human intervention. These tools are designed to handle specific tasks and can work asynchronously, allowing for greater efficiency and productivity.
