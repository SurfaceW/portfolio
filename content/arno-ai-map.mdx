## Optimizing AI Workflows: Key AI Working Procedures

To effectively harness artificial intelligence, understanding different AI working procedures is crucial. These models define how humans and AI collaborate for optimal productivity:

- **Human First, AI Assist**: human is focusing on the high-level tasks and design to instruct AI for high-level decision making or cross-multiple domain tasks.
- **AI First, Human Assist in Sync**: human design the task and instruct AI to do the task in a synchronous way, and human is focusing on revise and review the AI's work till the task is done.
- **AI First, Human Assist in Async**: human design the task and instruct AI to do the task in an asynchronous way, AI using `Agentic` approach to do the task, and human is focusing on later review and revise the AI's work till the task is done. These tasks are usually self-contained and not coupled with other domains, so AI can work independently.

Let's take software development as an example:

### Human First, AI Assist

- App production, tech-architecture, and market high-level design within the artificial intelligence landscape.
- Core modules, core features, and core functions design.
- Key-decision making about the technology stack, architecture, and modules features, a vital part of AI best practices.
- Complex problem solving and reasoning, such as systematic and systemic reasoning.
- ...

> In this mode, Arno try to create a systemic and systematic approach to leverage the power of AI and personal context engineering to do the high-level design and decision making, and then use the AI to assist in the low-level tasks. This approach is central to productivity with AI.

### AI First, Human Assist in Sync

- app development, coding, and programming in specific modules
- write PRD, design documents, and technical documents
- code review, PR review, and design review
- software development lifecycle, such as devops, CI/CD, and testing
- ...

> In this mode, dedicated AI tools are used to assist in the coding and programming tasks, such as `Cursor`, `Github Copilot`, and `V0`. These tools are designed to work in sync with human developers, providing real-time assistance and suggestions.

### AI First, Human Assist in Async

- Do market or product research using specialized AI tools.
- Write unit-test and integration-test as part of an AI-driven development cycle.
- Refactor modules, features, and functions, optimizing AI workflows.
- Batch job on data processing or information processing.
- ...

> In this mode, AI tools are used to work independently on specific tasks, such as `Google Deep Research`, `Manus` and `Google Jules` which can run in the server-end or background without human intervention. These tools are designed to handle specific tasks and can work asynchronously, allowing for greater efficiency and productivity with AI.

## Practical AI Application Scenarios & Tool Recommendations

This section explores various scenarios where AI can be applied, along with recommended AI tools and platforms that fit each AI workflow.
