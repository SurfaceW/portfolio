## Optimizing AI Workflows: Key AI Working Procedures

To effectively harness artificial intelligence, understanding different AI working procedures is crucial. These models define how humans and AI collaborate for optimal productivity:

- **Human First, AI Assist**: human is focusing on the high-level tasks and design to instruct AI for high-level decision making or cross-multiple domain tasks.
- **AI First, Human Assist in Sync**: human design the task and instruct AI to do the task in a synchronous way, and human is focusing on revise and review the AI's work till the task is done.
- **AI First, Human Assist in Async**: human design the task and instruct AI to do the task in an asynchronous way, AI using `Agentic` approach to do the task, and human is focusing on later review and revise the AI's work till the task is done. These tasks are usually self-contained and not coupled with other domains, so AI can work independently.

Let's take software development as an example:

### Human First, AI Assist

- App production, tech-architecture, and market high-level design within the artificial intelligence landscape.
- Core modules, core features, and core functions design.
- Key-decision making about the technology stack, architecture, and modules features, a vital part of AI best practices.
- Complex problem solving and reasoning, such as systematic and systemic reasoning.
- ...

> In this mode, Arno try to create a systemic and systematic approach to leverage the power of AI and personal context engineering to do the high-level design and decision making, and then use the AI to assist in the low-level tasks. This approach is central to productivity with AI.

### AI First, Human Assist in Sync

- app development, coding, and programming in specific modules
- write PRD, design documents, and technical documents
- code review, PR review, and design review
- software development lifecycle, such as devops, CI/CD, and testing
- ...

> In this mode, dedicated AI tools are used to assist in the coding and programming tasks, such as `Cursor`, `Github Copilot`, and `V0`. These tools are designed to work in sync with human developers, providing real-time assistance and suggestions.

### AI First, Human Assist in Async

> ALL RUNNING in the background, passively and asynchronously.

- Do market or product research using specialized AI tools.
- Write unit-test and integration-test as part of an AI-driven development cycle.
- Refactor modules, features, and functions, optimizing AI workflows.
- Batch job on data processing or information processing.
- ...

> In this mode, AI tools are used to work independently on specific tasks, such as `Google Deep Research`, `Manus` and `Google Jules` which can run in the server-end or background without human intervention. These tools are designed to handle specific tasks and can work asynchronously, allowing for greater efficiency and productivity with AI.

## Practical AI Application Scenarios & Tool Recommendations

This section explores various scenarios where AI can be applied, along with recommended AI tools and platforms that fit each AI workflow.

### Meta Thoughts

- use **Project / workspace** of OpenAI ChatGPT or Google's Notebook ML to organize related context info in a project.
- use **thinking tool** driven for QA and guide AI to dive deeper, with search, deep-reasoning, and `Agentic` tools operations.
- use **personal context engine** to build the context to co-work with AI tools, platforms and services.
- define _SOP_ and use _Agentic Tool_ to batch execute the SOP.

### Daily QA

> Daily general QA task -> **Gemini Pro 2.5 / GPT5**, deep understanding and reasoning -> **Open AI O3Pro / GPT5**

General knowledge and information retrieval.

- public domain knowledge
- time sensitive information
- domain specific knowledge
- experience driven query
- personal context required query

dimension:

- open search based
- private search based
- domain specific pre-trained model based
- personal context based
- direct or reasoning based

### AI in Coding & Programming: Tools and Techniques

> Augment x Gemini-Cli (Claude 4 / o3 / Gemini Pro 2.5)

Programming and coding tasks.

- vibe-coding & code-generation (codex, augment) for me, VSCode is the HUB for various of agentic tools and AI powered services and MCP
- tabs engineering, quick editing contents as needed
- software-development-lifecycle -> devops agentic tools
- use workspace / project as context QA (in ChatGPT)

### AI for Research, Study & Learning: Enhancing Knowledge Discovery

> Google Deep Research x Gemini Pro 2.5 x Google Artifact x Google Notebook ML (Knowledge based QA)

or

> OpenAI ChatGPT DeepResearch x OpenAI ChatGPT Agent Mode to co-work with content and QA research

- public domain knowledge based
- private domain knowledge based
- professional & profound knowledge based
- short v.s. long form of report (research, study, learning, etc.)
- organize and produce content in one workspace or generate artifacts to share results in need

---

Arno's SOP for research types of topics.

- create workspace for context gathering and basic QA (in one workspace)
- elaborate topics / problems with QA linked to **thinking models**, your thoughts, ideas, and experiences (Human First, AI Assist), ask interesting and deep questions and try to use AI to solve and combine your first-thoughts
- DeepResearch topic (shallow, deep x rich and poor context)
- generate basic Artifact (article + webpage)
- DeepResearch + O3-Pro to research topic
- integrate those results together -> Generate Final Artifact (WebPage or Article)
- [optional] add all of those materials and generated content or cited source into a Google Notebook ML for further analysis and insights

### AI in Media Generation: Images, Video, and Audio

> GPT4o x Midjourney x Google Video Generation

- image generation -> GPT 4o
- video generation
- audio generation
- 3D generation

### AI for Complex Problem Solving & Strategic Reasoning

> Deep Research x Reasoning models x Context Engine (for context engineering)
> Agentic Tools for SOP defined
> Think deep with **thinking-tools**

- context engineering: KESW x data x info
- complex reasoning
- systematic and systemic context powered
