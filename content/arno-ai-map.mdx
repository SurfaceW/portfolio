## Optimizing AI Workflows: Key AI Working Procedures

To effectively harness artificial intelligence, understanding different AI working procedures is crucial. These models define how humans and AI collaborate for optimal productivity:

- **Human First, AI Assist**: human is focusing on the high-level tasks and design to instruct AI for high-level decision making or cross-multiple domain tasks.
- **AI First, Human Assist in Sync**: human design the task and instruct AI to do the task in a synchronous way, and human is focusing on revise and review the AI's work till the task is done.
- **AI First, Human Assist in Async**: human design the task and instruct AI to do the task in an asynchronous way, AI using `Agentic` approach to do the task, and human is focusing on later review and revise the AI's work till the task is done. These tasks are usually self-contained and not coupled with other domains, so AI can work independently.

Let's take software development as an example:

### Human First, AI Assist

- App production, tech-architecture, and market high-level design within the artificial intelligence landscape.
- Core modules, core features, and core functions design.
- Key-decision making about the technology stack, architecture, and modules features, a vital part of AI best practices.
- Complex problem solving and reasoning, such as systematic and systemic reasoning.
- ...

> In this mode, Arno try to create a systemic and systematic approach to leverage the power of AI and personal context engineering to do the high-level design and decision making, and then use the AI to assist in the low-level tasks. This approach is central to productivity with AI.

### AI First, Human Assist in Sync

- app development, coding, and programming in specific modules
- write PRD, design documents, and technical documents
- code review, PR review, and design review
- software development lifecycle, such as devops, CI/CD, and testing
- ...

> In this mode, dedicated AI tools are used to assist in the coding and programming tasks, such as `Cursor`, `Github Copilot`, and `V0`. These tools are designed to work in sync with human developers, providing real-time assistance and suggestions.

### AI First, Human Assist in Async

> ALL RUNNING in the background, passively and asynchronously.

- Do market or product research using specialized AI tools.
- Write unit-test and integration-test as part of an AI-driven development cycle.
- Refactor modules, features, and functions, optimizing AI workflows.
- Batch job on data processing or information processing.
- ...

> In this mode, AI tools are used to work independently on specific tasks, such as `Google Deep Research`, `Manus` and `Google Jules` which can run in the server-end or background without human intervention. These tools are designed to handle specific tasks and can work asynchronously, allowing for greater efficiency and productivity with AI.

## Practical AI Application Scenarios & Tool Recommendations

This section explores various scenarios where AI can be applied, along with recommended AI tools and platforms that fit each AI workflow.

### Daily QA

> Daily general QA task -> **Gemini Pro / ChatGPT / Claude**, deep understanding and reasoning

General knowledge and information retrieval.

- personal _long-term_ memory matters in those daily QA tasks.
- add your preferred _instruction_ to the AI to help it to do the daily simple task better.
- use _search_ and _tools_ to work with app and real-time info and data.
- use _local file_ and chunks of text as extra context to work with.
- pick _long-time_ reasoning for relatively complex tasks.
- for more complex or important question (tasks), use _multi-models in comparison and combination_ to work with. (e.g. use strongest models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- use _agent-mode_ for files, images, code evaluation based tasks.

### Dedicated Tasks

For _dedicated tasks_, create Agent or Agentic Workflow to work with.

- use `GPTs` or `GEMs`(Gemini Agentic) to add system prompt, files (context), and tools to work with.
- for complex workflow, use _Code_ based, or _Workflow_ based agent to complete the task.
- use [_Alfred_](./alfred) liked quick launch and quick action to find your dedicated agents and workflows.

### Research, Study & Learning

For knowledge aggregation and research.

- use `DeepResearch` tools to combo(OpenAI + Google) to do the research and study for more perspective and insights.
- use `Workspace` to organize related context info in a project, using `Google Notebook ML` is a good choice.

Arno's SOP for research types of topics.

- create workspace for context gathering and basic QA (in one workspace)
- elaborate topics / problems with QA linked to **thinking models**, your thoughts, ideas, and experiences (Human First, AI Assist), ask interesting and deep questions and try to use AI to solve and combine your first-thoughts
- DeepResearch topic (shallow, deep x rich and poor context)
- generate basic Artifact (article + webpage)
- DeepResearch + Advanced Models to summary / organize and elaborate the topic
- integrate those results together -> Generate Final Artifact (WebPage or Article)
- [optional] add all of those materials and generated content or cited source into a Google Notebook ML for further analysis and insights

### Coding & Programming: Tools and Techniques

> Cursor x Cli Tools (ClaudeCode / GeminiCli / Codex)

Programming and coding tasks.

- vibe-coding & code-generation (codex, augment) for me, VSCode is the HUB for various of agentic tools and AI powered services and MCP
- tabs engineering, quick editing contents as needed
- software-development-lifecycle -> devops agentic tools
- use workspace / project as context QA (in ChatGPT)
- pick plugins / MCPs to connect to external services and tools
- encapsulate your SOPs of dev, and business workflows to skills

### AI in Media Generation: Images, Video, and Audio

- image generation -> GPT / Nano Banana Pro of Google
- video generation -> Seedance (Bytedance) / Sora (OpenAI) / Grok's mini video generation
- audio generation
- 3D objects generation

## Real Life Scenarios

### Meta Thoughts

> Arno is crafting `eThink` and `eGnite` app to let AI do the meta-thinking for daily thinking process and elaboration process.

I'm working in progress to craft them out 🧑‍🍳 ~

### Writing & Editing

- use `Cursor` first approach, for text-completion and editing, **all in markdown**.
- create GPT like [writing assistant](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6981d915073c8191bc4efc44519c96a9-arno-co-writing-assistant) to help me write and improve the writing quality.

### English Learning

- talk and interact with `ChatGPT` often, to practice your listening and speaking skills.
- instruct ChatGPT to always respond in both English and your own mother language at the same time for _reading_ and _writing_ skills.
- for each turn of conversation, ask ChatGPT to summarize all core-concepts and key-points in the conversation memorize and keep track of your memory use _Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve_ to solidate your memory.

### Information and Horizon

WIP

## idea that sparks

- dig deeper with deep research: one research -> research conception and topic -> deeper research and build the zoom-in and zoom-out effect

## Context Engineering: The Key to AI Productivity

WIP -> new article to write
