## Basic Editing Experience

- **Tab Engineer**
- **Multi-Line Edits**
- **Smart Rewrites**

## Chat

Chat lets you talk with an AI that sees your codebase. The chat can always see your current file and cursor, so you can ask it things like: "Is there a bug here?". You can add particular blocks of code to the context with *⌘+Shift+L* or `"@."` You can chat with your entire codebase with `⌘+Enter`.

- Instant Apply
- Codebase Answers
- Directly Reference Code
- Images using multi-modal to generate code
- Ask web use `@Web` indicator (search)
- Add documentation address as more ctx. for RAG process

## Editing Code and Cmd + K

⌘ K lets you edit and write code with the AI. To edit, try selecting some code, click "Edit," and describe how the code should be changed. To generate completely new code, just type ⌘ K without selecting anything.

- Fast Edits
- Terminal Cmd + K
- Quick Questions
- Inline Generations
- Inline Edits

## Context Engineering

- Enable Workspace / Project Indexing
- General Cursor Rule
- `.cursorrules` for project system prompt

High Quality Cursor Rules Example let's take React project for example:

```markdown
# React App Development Instructions

## Core Principles

- Design first, then implement
- Use appropriate state management (zustand recommended)
- Decompose UI into View, Business, and Basic components
- Enforce data immutability
- Maintain component orthogonality (separation of responsibilities)
- Use object-oriented paradigm with TypeScript for complex business logic

## Performance Optimization

- Prevent unnecessary re-renders:
  - Don't create component classes in render functions
  - Pass state to leaf nodes when possible
  - Pass children as props
  - Use React.memo to prevent downward updates
  - Use useMemo/useCallback for expensive operations
  - Use unique keys for lists
  - Use useMemo for Context values
  - Separate data and API methods in Context
  - Use multiple Context providers instead of one
  - Implement Context Selectors

- Decompose components to minimize render scope
- Implement appropriate caching strategies
- Use RenderHighlight in React DevTools to detect render issues
- Optimize package size with TreeShaking

## Stability Guidelines

- Use mature libraries with version locks
- Prevent circular dependencies in Hooks
- Implement XSS protection
- Add ErrorBoundary for error handling

## Maintainability Guidelines

- Unify code style with linters
- Standardize directory and project organization
- Apply design patterns and principles
- Strictly separate views and logic
- Limit file length to 500 lines maximum
```

- `@` Symbol boost
  - `Files`: auto / full-file / outline / chunks
  - `Folders`: is especially useful for [**long context chat**](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/overview#long-context-chat) where you want to provide a lot of context to the AI.
  - `Code` : select and add to chat
  - `Docs` : reference to docs lib in project
  - `Git` : check the git diff and info
  - `CodeBase` : Through `@Codebase`, Cursor Chat goes through these steps until it finds the most important pieces of code to use.
    - Gathering: scanning through your codebase for important files / code chunks
    - Reranking: reordering the context items based on relevancy to the query
    - Reasoning: thinking through a plan of using the context
    - Generating: coming up with a response
  - `Web` : use extra context searching with web
  - `Chat` : with specific chat-history / sessions
  - `Definitions` : symbol adds all nearby definitions to Cmd K as context.
- PastedLinks
- `.cursorignore` : This file allows you to specify which files or directories should be excluded from indexing, ensuring that only relevant content is considered during the context engineering process.

### Cursor Rules

Cursor Rules are powerful context-sharing tools in Cursor that bridge the gap between composers and chat interactions.

Cursor Rules serve as collections of thoughts, rules, and documentation that can be:

- Shared between different parts of your development environment
- Referenced using the `@` syntax
- Enhanced with file attachments
- Used as dynamic templates for various development scenarios

General Scenarios

1. **Dynamic Boilerplate Generation**

   - Create templates for common code patterns
   - Store project-specific scaffolding rules
   - Maintain consistent code structure across your team

2. **Architecture Documentation**

   - Frontend specifications
   - Backend design patterns
   - Data model documentation
   - System architecture guidelines

3. **Development Guidelines**

   - Coding standards
   - Project-specific rules
   - Best practices
   - Team conventions

My experience guide:

* use `.context` folder to collect all the related context, try to use git submodule to manage the context sharing across different projects.
* use `.cursor` directory to manage all the cursor related files, including `.cursorrules`, `.cursorignore`, etc and manage them via cursor app it self.
* `.cursor` can reference `.context` folder for context sharing.

### .cursor folder

Obey the rules of Cursor Editor and is the main entry for cursor related files.

For more cursor rule guide, you can refer to [Awesome Cursor Rules](https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules?tab=readme-ov-file#frontend-frameworks-and-libraries).

### .context folder

> May have variety of files, here are some examples:

* `prompts`: typical prompts reference
* `examples`: few shots examples
  * `code`: code examples
  * `types`: types declaration examples or interfaces declaration examples
* `docs`: docs reference
* `architecture`: architecture reference /guide
* `projects`: projects reference for sub-apps or sub-modules
* ...

## Advanced Composer / Agent

Composer is your AI coding assistant that lives in your editor. It helps you explore code, write new features, and modify existing code without leaving your workflow. Use `⌘I` to open it, and `⌘N` to create a new Composer.

Enable Agent with `⌘.` to get a coding partner that proactively works with your codebase:

- Automatically pull relevant context (try `@Recommended`)
- Run terminal commands
- Create and modify files
- Search code semantically
- Execute file operations

Agent can make up to 25 tool calls before stopping. For now, Agent supports only Claude models.

- Iterate on lints → Composer attempts to fix linting issues in generated code for most programming languages. If Composer detects lint errors, it will try to fix them automatically when this feature is enabled. Currently, only one iteration is supported.

## MCP

* use MCP for your private tools usage, try to encapsulate your tools into MCP server and provide extra context for coding related things to Cursor.
* example MCP server can be found in [awesome-mcp-server](https://mcp.so/servers) and some github awesome lists.

## VSCode Features

- VSCode Extensions and Configs migration
- Search with Alfred with `PROJECT`

## Engineering Workflow

- Commit Msg Generation → in git tab
- Bug Finder → based on the diff info and git related things

## Reference

- Cursor Docs -> [https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/migrate-from-vscode](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/migrate-from-vscode)

## Updates

- 2025-03-16: add cursor rules and agent related content like `.cursor` and `.context` dir usage and examples, and MCP guide.
