## Github Copilot Patterns

* direct completion
  * tip: multiple choices
* write tests
  * chat with `/test`
* explain code
  * chat with `/explain`
* fix bugs
  * error with extension to trigger fix suggestion of copilot
* chat with code context in your editor
  * chat with any code related to your current context of file and code language server


## Code Review Patterns

* code comment / commit msg assistant
* code review assistant
* code security concern assistant

## Code Generation Patterns

* maintain your own prompt garden in Github
  * for example: build your own prompt base like expert
  * show Arno's prompt garden with vscode flow of writing and design prompt in a simple way

### BOTS as simple agents

* POE with simple bot like agents
  * example: next.js ant-design component prompt agent
* OpenAI GPTs with more complex agents like: tools / functions calls / file-context embedding / ...

### Complex context representation

## Tools and Platforms


* Low code integration with API invocation platforms like `v0.dev` pattern components based
* Prompt to fully generated code and project site based on continuous prompting
  * multi-modal based


## Future Patterns

* semi-auto-meta pattern: human organize key strokes of multiple agents to complete a complex task with structured complex context (very matured AI pattern in the future) inside one `work in one workspace` (like Notion) to structure the context and provide the context to AI agents to keep complex operations in one place. -> idea from elaboration studio of Arno.
* full-auto-meta pattern: multiple agents working together to complete a complex task with structured complex context (very matured AI pattern in the future).
